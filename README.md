Restaurant selector is an app made for people who are being indecisive about where they want to go eat. The app allows users to create a list of places they're wanting to eat at and will select the restaurant they eat at from that list. Users can also get a list of top fast food and sit down restaurants on the our choices page.

## How to use Restaurant Selector
Enter the name, type, and rating of the restaurant, then click 'Add Restaurant'
This will add that restaurant to a database of user choices. The user can add as many restaurants they want to this list.

Now press the 'Get Restaurant' button to see where you're going to eat.

When the window pops up you can click the directions button to find the directions to your selected restaurant. If the 'Try Again' button is pressed a too bad message will appear. To return to the home page press the 'back' button.

The Our Choices page works the same way as the home page except the list of restaurants is already made. The user only need to press the button for each catagory and be given where they will eat.
